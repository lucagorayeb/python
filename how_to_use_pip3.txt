If you try to use pip3 to install something in your ubuntu this notice will show

"error: externally-managed-environment

× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
    python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.
    
    If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,
    create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.
    Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make
    sure you have python3-full installed.
    
    If you wish to install a non-Debian packaged Python application,
    it may be easiest to use pipx install xyz, which will manage a
    virtual environment for you. Make sure you have pipx installed.
    
    See /usr/share/doc/python3.12/README.venv for more information.

note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.
hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification."

You could do 2 things to resolved that:

1 - Force your system to accept de pip3 with de following command:
	NOTE: This is not recomended because could break your OS
	
	pip3 install xyz --break-system-packages
	
	(xyz is the lib you want install)

2 - Create a virtual enviorment whit venv:
	Install venv with:
	sudo apt install -y python3-venv
	
	Create a virtual enviorment:
	python3 -m venv your/path/that/you/want/create/venv/
	
	Creating a alias for venv:
	
	cat ~/.bashrc (search for "Alias definitions")
	
	if Alias definion was like:
	# Alias definitions.
	# You may want to put all your additions into a separate file like
	# ~/.bash_aliases, instead of adding them here directly.
	# See /usr/share/doc/bash-doc/examples in the bash-doc package. 
	if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
    		. ~/.bash_aliases
	fi	
	(ends on "fi")
	
	type echo "alias venve_py = source path\that\your\venv\is\installed\bin\activate" >> ~/.bash_aliases (ENTER) 
	
	type source ~/.bashrc (ENTER)
	
	type cd  path\that\your\venv\is\installed (ENTER) 
	
	type venve_py (ENTER) 

	you will see (venv) luca@luca-desktop:path\that\your\venv\is\installed

	See /usr/share/doc/python3.12/README.venv for more information

If you want know more about venv I sugest you to read the official documentationon https://docs.python.org/pt-br/3/library/venv.html
