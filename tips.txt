If you try to use pip3 to install something in your ubuntu this notice will show

"error: externally-managed-environment

× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
    python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.
    
    If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,
    create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.
    Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make
    sure you have python3-full installed.
    
    If you wish to install a non-Debian packaged Python application,
    it may be easiest to use pipx install xyz, which will manage a
    virtual environment for you. Make sure you have pipx installed.
    
    See /usr/share/doc/python3.12/README.venv for more information.

note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.
hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification."

You could do 2 things to resolved that:

1 - Force your system to accept de pip3 with de following command:
	NOTE: This is not recomended because could break your OS
	
	pip3 install xyz --break-system-packages
	
	(xyz is the lib you want install)

2 - Create a virtual enviorment whit venv:
	Install venv with:
	sudo apt install -y python3-venv
	
	Create a virtual enviorment:
	python3 -m venv your/path/that/you/want/create/venv/
	
	Creating a alias:

	See /usr/share/doc/python3.12/README.venv for more information

If you want know more about venv I sugest you to read the official documentationon https://docs.python.org/pt-br/3/library/venv.html
